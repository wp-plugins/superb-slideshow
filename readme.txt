This is a strong, cross browser fade in slideshow script that incorporates some of your most requested features all rolled into one. Each instance of a fade in slideshow on the page is completely independent of the other, with support for different features selectively enabled for each slideshow.

*   Fade in effect that has the current image fading over the previous one.            
*   Automatic slideshow.             
*   Slideshow can be set to stop rotating after N cycles.        
*   Each slide can be optionally hyperlinked.    
*   Each slide can have an optional description associated with it.     
*   Descriptions can either be set to show on demand (when the mouse rolls over the slide), or be always visible until explicitly dismissed.    
*   Persistence of last viewed slide supported, so when the user reloads the page, the slideshow resumes from the last slide.        
*   Slideshow automatically pauses onMouseover.
